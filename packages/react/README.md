# GrÃ©goire's icons for React

My favorite icons ready to use in React projects. Typescript ready.

## Usage

```TSX

export const App = () => (
    <>

        Basic usage (24px, color inherit of text)
        <People />

        Change color
        <Bulb color="red">

        Using Tailwind
        <Sparkles className="fill-palettePurple" />

    </>
);

```
